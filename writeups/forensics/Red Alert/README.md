Flag: `EPT{should_have_played_brood_war_instead}`
## Description
```
Those idiots from IT Security claim I have created a "Red Alert" with my C2 traffic. They wanted my computer, but I am unable to comply (building in progress). Told them that it is called C&C and gave them a pcap and a memdump. Silos needed, unit lost, leave me alone!

*Hint: The flag is in the packet capture but you probably need something from the memory dump to retrieve it.*
