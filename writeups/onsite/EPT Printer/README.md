**NOTE:**

You need a valid onsite card/badge to be able to solve this challenge.

Remember that the flag needs to be in this format: `EPT{x}`

The api_proxy containers are **not** a part of the challenge, you do not need to look into them to solve the challenge, they are there just to make the challenge function. In addition, the webapp needs to run on port 8000 if you launch it locally.

You need to scan your card at the printers to actually print the job. It might also take a few seconds before the printer actually prints.
