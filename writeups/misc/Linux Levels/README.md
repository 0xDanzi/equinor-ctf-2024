Flag: `EPT{Some_unix_Commands_are_always_fun_to_know}`
## Description
```
Permissions are a key part of Linux security. Can you navigate through the levels and find the flag?

You will find the flag in the file flag.txt in the home directory of the user level7.

To move between levels you can use the command `su - levelx` where X is the level you want to move to.

The server is open for ssh on port 22.

You can access the levels.eptc.tf server using SSH using:

Username: `level0`
Password: `EPT_CTF_2024`

In your terminal, use the following command to connect:

`ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no level0@levels.eptc.tf`
```
