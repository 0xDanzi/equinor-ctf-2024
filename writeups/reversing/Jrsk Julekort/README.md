## Description
```
In 2019 Nordpolar Sikkerhetstjeneste (NPST) used a custom stegography algorithm to hide a secret message in a Christmas card. The implementation was not perfect, so we have created an improved version of the algorithm to make sure Santas communication is secure. 
However, we have yet to implement the decryption function. Can you help us out?

** Note: ** This is the exact same binary as for "JÃ¦rsk julepwn".

** Note2: ** Reading the solution to the original challenge might give you a few pointers. But you can find UnblvR's writeup here: https://github.com/myrdyr/ctf-writeups/tree/master/npst19#mystisk-julekort
