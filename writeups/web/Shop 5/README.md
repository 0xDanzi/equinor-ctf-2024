Flag: `EPT{G0in6_1n_l0ops_to0_f45t_m4k3s_m3_d1zzy}`
## Description
```
It appears that PHP was not the solution after all, so we switched to the much more modern and secure Python language.
Fortunatly, using modern frameworks also guarantees that our application is fully secure!

If you should manage, somehow to buy the new exclusive EPT fidget toy merchandise, you can claim 5 physical instances at the admin booth after you have bought the toy in the shop and submitted the flag on the platform!
