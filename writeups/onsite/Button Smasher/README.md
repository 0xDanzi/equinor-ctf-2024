## Description
```
We are total noobs when it comes to hardware, so we decided to smash some buttons.

We forgot the sequence though, are you able to figure it out?

**NOTE:** This is an onsite challenge, you can find it some place in the venue. This challenge can be solved on your own computer, you only need to come over once you know the correct input.
