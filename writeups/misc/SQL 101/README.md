## Description
```
There are a lot of login forms on this page, but unfortunately one of them is apparently vulnerable. Luckily, the rest of the forms are fine so in general we should be safe. However, to avoid hackers, we had to set the session validity to 60 seconds to ensure hackers have no time to explore the protected areas of the web app. The login endpoints are refreshed every 30 seconds to avoid hackers going straight back in.
