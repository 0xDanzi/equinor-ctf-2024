## Description
```
My dad kept beating me in basketball. I think it was because I am terrible at basketball.

So I made a basketball game where I can choose how many points I get on each of my shots, 
and I even let myself start each game, but I still can't beat my dad.

Now I live my life filled with regret and trauma, can you please beat my dad for me?
