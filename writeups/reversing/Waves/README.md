# Waves
Author: Surprior

Flag: `EPT{SEAOFSINUS}`
## Description
```
I found a formula that lets me create ocean waves out of images of flags. Check out the ocean I made from my flag! You can also draw your own flag, and enjoy your waves.

Note: This challenge uses WebGPU, which is only supported by modern browsers. [Click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API#browser_compatibility) to see how you can experience the future of web graphics. You may also have to enable a feature flag in you browser.

It is solvable without WebGpu support, but you won't get to see the pretty waves.

Two plugins that will help you find what you need: [webgpu-devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webgpu-devtools/ckabpgjkjmbkfmichbbgcgbelkbbpopi) and [ghidra-wasm-plugin](https://github.com/nneonneo/ghidra-wasm-plugin)
